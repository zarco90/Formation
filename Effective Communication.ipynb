    "#### The Basis of Good Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at examples of bad writing and no surprise, you can tell the difference between bad writing and good writing. This is good news. You're already on your way to learning how to write. The question becomes, how do we create good writing?\n",
    "You need to understand the principles that really feed into the whole process. First, you need to understand the main quality of good business writing, what we're always working towards when we write. I call it the windowpane theory and it comes from a quote by George Orwell. He's famous for writing the classic books 1984 and Animal Farm. Orwell said, good writing is a windowpane. First of all, a windowpane is something that we can see through. A dirty window pane can't do its job. If its too dirty to see through, it looses its function. You have to work to see beyond it. Our writing should be transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best writting practices:\n",
    "* Clarity above all - have I been as clear as possible? Cut extra words, add bullet points for your list to make them easier to read and start to really craft your reading so that it's clear.\n",
    "* Waste no time - Your readers are very busy. If you give your reader too much to read, you might be ignored or simply lost in the shuffle. You need to work intentionally, through design and revision, to create a short document for your reader.\n",
    "* Be the authority - Our goal with our tone isn't to sound smart, it's to be smart. When a writer writes to sound smart, they fail, because complexity detracts from your goal. We don't want our readers to have to do any extra work. Choosing sentence structure or fancy vocabulary so that you sound smart actually does just the opposite. Say what you mean, simply and directly. And be the authority when you write. Avoid wishy-washy words like should, maybe, could, might, or think, when you write.\n",
    "* Design your document. Good writers spend time on formatting and design. The very first thing that your reader sees, isn't the words on the page, it's how your document looks.\n",
    "* Scaffold well to write well.\n",
    "* There is no good writing without good revision\n",
    "* Write your purpose - You don't need to justify your purpose before you ever get there. You need to start with your purpose and then you can build your justifications later in your document (introduction trap). You have to be willing to cut the things that don't fit our scaffold and don't address your purpose. And you have to be willing to do it mercilessly. A good tool to use when you begin is to start with the words, the purpose of this memo. That forces you to stick to the point and jump right in. This is just a first draft. You can go back and revise your first sentence after you've gotten started.\n",
    "* Grammar matters - We want to control the reading experience so our audience understands exactly what we want them to. That's why grammar's important. It makes you look good and helps you get your ideas across with clarity.\n",
    "* Activate your voice - Change from passive to active voice.\n",
    "* Hack away at the unessential"

    "In most of our design works, some degree of tension is nice to have. But knowing what kind of tension and how much, is critical. And knowing what tension actually is. Tension is simply putting movement or life into our work, making it feel as if something is happening. There are a number of ways we can do that. The first is simply moving items closer together or to the edge of the frame. Or out of balance, or by tilting elements or with the use of sharp angles.\n",

    "Proximity simply says, if we move any two items closer together in our composition, it will create an area of interest. It will create tension and it will attract the audience, it will bring them in. You can actually tell your viewers where to look first, by simply clustering elements together. Move elements closer together, you grab their eye and pull it in. Move them apart, and you relax that attraction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to build a little tension in your work is to move elements to the very edge of the frame. Simply moving an element to the edge of the screen sets up a high degree of tension. If you're designing a business care, there's no law in the world that says you can't shove the name of the company to the edge and even a little bit off the card. It's an incredible way to get people to feel a sense of dynamics and movement.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first is your work is not precious. Your designs aren't precious no matter how great you think they are. What really matters isn't the design, isn't the product itself, it's your creative ability. It's your creative style. That's the thing that's precious. After all, if you feel that your work is a result of a rare and wonderous process, then you'll rarely have wonderful ideas. It's important to remember that you can always redo something. You can always go back to the drawing board and start over. This is where you become a true designer. If you design long enough, someone is going to tell you, a client, or a boss, or your audience or your co-workers, they're going to tell you that you haven't done the job. They're completely unhappy with the product that you've come up with and that means that you have to start over again. Your first response to that is I can't start over again, this is perfect. The thing I've delivered is absolutely perfect, it can't be better. The thing is of course, it can always be better and it can always be different. It's just a matter of working hard enough, exploring, learning how to work with elements and making things happen. That's what precious. Not the project itself but your creative abilities.\n",

    "In graphic design, it's so important to have as much distance and time as you can possibly get in judging your own work. We all know that we're really our own worst judges. We can't really see our work with objective eyes, we're too close to it."
