    "#### The Basis of Good Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at examples of bad writing and no surprise, you can tell the difference between bad writing and good writing. This is good news. You're already on your way to learning how to write. The question becomes, how do we create good writing?\n",
    "You need to understand the principles that really feed into the whole process. First, you need to understand the main quality of good business writing, what we're always working towards when we write. I call it the windowpane theory and it comes from a quote by George Orwell. He's famous for writing the classic books 1984 and Animal Farm. Orwell said, good writing is a windowpane. First of all, a windowpane is something that we can see through. A dirty window pane can't do its job. If its too dirty to see through, it looses its function. You have to work to see beyond it. Our writing should be transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best writting practices:\n",
    "* Clarity above all - have I been as clear as possible? Cut extra words, add bullet points for your list to make them easier to read and start to really craft your reading so that it's clear.\n",
    "* Waste no time - Your readers are very busy. If you give your reader too much to read, you might be ignored or simply lost in the shuffle. You need to work intentionally, through design and revision, to create a short document for your reader.\n",
    "* Be the authority - Our goal with our tone isn't to sound smart, it's to be smart. When a writer writes to sound smart, they fail, because complexity detracts from your goal. We don't want our readers to have to do any extra work. Choosing sentence structure or fancy vocabulary so that you sound smart actually does just the opposite. Say what you mean, simply and directly. And be the authority when you write. Avoid wishy-washy words like should, maybe, could, might, or think, when you write.\n",
    "* Design your document. Good writers spend time on formatting and design. The very first thing that your reader sees, isn't the words on the page, it's how your document looks.\n",
    "* Scaffold well to write well.\n",
    "* There is no good writing without good revision\n",
    "* Write your purpose - You don't need to justify your purpose before you ever get there. You need to start with your purpose and then you can build your justifications later in your document (introduction trap). You have to be willing to cut the things that don't fit our scaffold and don't address your purpose. And you have to be willing to do it mercilessly. A good tool to use when you begin is to start with the words, the purpose of this memo. That forces you to stick to the point and jump right in. This is just a first draft. You can go back and revise your first sentence after you've gotten started.\n",
    "* Grammar matters - We want to control the reading experience so our audience understands exactly what we want them to. That's why grammar's important. It makes you look good and helps you get your ideas across with clarity. "

    "\n",
    "When we're thinking about working with typography. The first thing is use type purposefully. Don't pick a typeface because you think it's cute, or because it happens to be the typeface that everybody's using right now. Pick a type face because it matches your message. Also, remember your reader. First and foremost, when we're designing a reader comes first. We have to make sure all this type we're putting on a page, is understandable. And, think about the form of type. You could actually have fun with it and have it still be readable as well."

    "* I vs me: I is a first person subject pronoun. I is always the subject. You use I when you are taking the action in a sentence. Me is an object pronoun. You use me when the action is being done to you or when you use a preposition. Most of the confusion comes when there's more than two parties in a sentence. The easiest way to check yourself is to eliminate all of them, except you.\n",
    "* Modifiers: A modifier is a word or a phrase that modifies or enhances the meaning that you impart in a sentence. Modifiers can add interest to writing if they're used correctly. Modifiers are adverbs, adjectives, or phrases. They must be next to what they modify. If they're not, then you lose clarity.\n",
    "* Serial comma: In a list of three or more items, a serial comma is placed before the words and, or or. Our goal is to provide the best possible reading experience. Even when we think something is clear, it might not be to our reader.\n",
    "* Pronouns: Pronouns are the parts of speech that take the place of a noun. Pronouns refer to the closest preceding noun in the sentence, to the closest noun that comes before the pronoun. Problems of clarity arise when what I think of as the anchoring noun, otherwise known as the antecedent, isn't clear. Or even the antecedent is hidden. You should never use a pronoun in a topic sentence for a paragraph. If you're starting a new paragraph, you should treat it as new, as if there's no antecedent.\n",
    "* Apostrophe abuse: Don't make a plural with an apostrophe. You use an apostrophe in a contraction or with a possessive. There's an important exception to this rule. And that has to do with its without an apostrophe versus it's with an apostrophe. This is a rule you just simply need to memorize. Its without an apostrophe is used for the possessive case.\n",
    "* You're vs your: You are (contracted) versus possession.\n",
    "* That vs which: When you use a modifier in a sentence, that provides essential information, you use that. Because the information is essential to my sentence I also don't use commas around the modifying phrase. However, when you use a modifier in a sentence that provides unessential information, you use which, and you do use a comma."
