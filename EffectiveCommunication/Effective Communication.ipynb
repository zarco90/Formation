    "#### The Basis of Good Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at examples of bad writing and no surprise, you can tell the difference between bad writing and good writing. This is good news. You're already on your way to learning how to write. The question becomes, how do we create good writing?\n",
    "You need to understand the principles that really feed into the whole process. First, you need to understand the main quality of good business writing, what we're always working towards when we write. I call it the windowpane theory and it comes from a quote by George Orwell. He's famous for writing the classic books 1984 and Animal Farm. Orwell said, good writing is a windowpane. First of all, a windowpane is something that we can see through. A dirty window pane can't do its job. If its too dirty to see through, it looses its function. You have to work to see beyond it. Our writing should be transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best writting practices:\n",
    "* Clarity above all - have I been as clear as possible? Cut extra words, add bullet points for your list to make them easier to read and start to really craft your reading so that it's clear.\n",
    "* Waste no time - Your readers are very busy. If you give your reader too much to read, you might be ignored or simply lost in the shuffle. You need to work intentionally, through design and revision, to create a short document for your reader.\n",
    "* Be the authority - Our goal with our tone isn't to sound smart, it's to be smart. When a writer writes to sound smart, they fail, because complexity detracts from your goal. We don't want our readers to have to do any extra work. Choosing sentence structure or fancy vocabulary so that you sound smart actually does just the opposite. Say what you mean, simply and directly. And be the authority when you write. Avoid wishy-washy words like should, maybe, could, might, or think, when you write.\n",
    "* Design your document. Good writers spend time on formatting and design. The very first thing that your reader sees, isn't the words on the page, it's how your document looks.\n",
    "* Scaffold well to write well.\n",
    "* There is no good writing without good revision\n",
    "* Write your purpose - You don't need to justify your purpose before you ever get there. You need to start with your purpose and then you can build your justifications later in your document (introduction trap). You have to be willing to cut the things that don't fit our scaffold and don't address your purpose. And you have to be willing to do it mercilessly. A good tool to use when you begin is to start with the words, the purpose of this memo. That forces you to stick to the point and jump right in. This is just a first draft. You can go back and revise your first sentence after you've gotten started.\n",
    "* Grammar matters - We want to control the reading experience so our audience understands exactly what we want them to. That's why grammar's important. It makes you look good and helps you get your ideas across with clarity.\n",
    "* Activate your voice - Change from passive to active voice.\n",
    "* Hack away at the unessential"

Tension is simply putting movement or life into our work, making it feel as if something is happening. There are a number of ways we can do that. The first is simply moving items closer together or to the edge of the frame. Or out of balance, or by tilting elements or with the use of sharp angles.\n",

It will create tension and it will attract the audience, it will bring them in. You can actually tell your viewers where to look first, by simply clustering elements together. Move elements closer together, you grab their eye and pull it in. Move them apart, and you relax that attraction.\n",

What really matters isn't the design, isn't the product itself, it's your creative ability. It's your creative style. That's the thing that's precious. After all, if you feel that your work is a result of a rare and wonderous process, then you'll rarely have wonderful ideas. It's important to remember that you can always redo something. You can always go back to the drawing board and start over. This is where you become a true designer. If you design long enough, someone is going to tell you, a client, or a boss, or your audience or your co-workers, they're going to tell you that you haven't done the job. They're completely unhappy with the product that you've come up with and that means that you have to start over again. Your first response to that is I can't start over again, this is perfect. The thing I've delivered is absolutely perfect, it can't be better. The thing is of course, it can always be better and it can always be different. It's just a matter of working hard enough, exploring, learning how to work with elements and making things happen. That's what precious. Not the project itself but your creative abilities.\n",

You're thinking about things, but you're not thinking of the name you need or the idea you're trying to grasp. They work against you horribly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second category or verbal survival reactions. A string of words, anything that you come up with that you're trying to buy yourself time to think of your next idea. Really they just get in the way and instead of buying you time to think of something smart to say they make you sound inarticulate, stupid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last category is the worst, physical survival reactions. Things your body does you just, why my body doing this, sweating uncontrollably, that's horrible. The opposite, dry mouth, where there's no water at all, or using your hands like this a lot as if you're trying to swim through the talk, you can't stop it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So my point in recognizing this long list of negative attributes is not to say that we should put them in a box and say, you know what? We all do them. We all struggle with this. No one is perfect. Survival reactions are not your fault. They don't belong to you. So recognize them for what they are. Automatic reactions, box them up and put them away. We're going to replace them with a rule-governed formula for success.\n",

    "Think about that. What I'm suggesting is these survival reactions, they get in our way and we begin to concentrate on them instead of what's before us. We concentrate on our shaking hands so we don't think about the content. We concentrate on whether we're sweating or our mouth dry and so we don't pay attention to what our audience is telling us, to their physical cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once we control fear, once we put fear away, our mind suddenly expands. We can concentrate on the whole room. We can deal with the audience on a level that they don't even realize we're dealing with them.\n",

We can replace it with a rule governed system. We can learn that system so it's second nature so that when we feel ourselves begin to fail ourselves we reach back to that backbone.

It is simply where you walk on stage, and you welcome the audience to your presentation. You give the title, and then you thank them. You thank them for coming. Set out the tone then introduce yourself. This is very important you have to tell them why you are speaking to them in the context that you are. There are many context, and there's many good reasons to speak for them. It's not a very long explanation. Just tell them who you are. Then, acknowledge them. Memorize your lectures. But, in this one instance. I'm going to suggest that you be very careful with your words and perhaps draw a piece of paper and read. Why? Because when you acknowledge people you need to get their names and their titles correctly. You need to accurately acknowledge, this is very important and if you passed over the acknowledgements you may later find that someone's feelings were hurt or that they're somewhat upset with you. It establishes you as a leader among of group of people and those people are various.\n",

Generosity appears, it appears to be that you are giving something away but really they are giving everything away. By being generous you actually lose nothing. Generosity appears to weaken your authority but it actually allows you to seize authority, to become the leader, to become the person who can give acknowledgement or deny acknowledgement and that's a very powerful position. So, by being generous, by being warm, you can establish yourself. You can establish the trust and sincerity of the community. And from trust and sincerity, come your authority to speak."

And then if you run out of time or if you get interrupted and you don't get all your content in and maybe you don't even have time for the conclusion, it's all right because the whole talk is a circle.  But nevertheless all talks conclude, and if you've done things right and weighed your timeout, counted things out, so everything makes sense then you'll get to a conclusion. And your conclusion should have, and you know this, three points. It should have a summary, a place where you say in sum, I've covered and then you out the things you've covered. And then, after that, you should have a discussion. And the discussion is important because what would be ideal is that you give your audience something to think about, something so if there's a Q&A session, a listener could ask the question, pursue that question. And if you were smart, you'd seed into the discussion the questions you want to pursue. But maybe there's not a Q&A period. Maybe you'd just like to have your audience think about something.

The Rolling Stones appear to be one thing. Spontaneous, free form, breaking any formula and any law you can give them. But in fact they're very disciplined, they're rehearsed. Each one of them is geared towards creating a brand identity. And that brand identity is interesting because the brand identity, it's something that they create through rehearsal, but it's also something that they create with their audience in front of them.

But in sticking to the script he or she forecloses on his or her personality and bludgeons the audience into boredom. We don't want that at all.

    "#### You are your own harshest critic\n",
    "\n",
    "So successful presentation comes down to the hard work of practicing a script. In this video and the next, I'm going to take you through two techniques I have towards practicing. But what is a script? Well, a script can be anything. A script can be a 30 page document that's written out over months, revised by multiple people. A script can be a slide deck that people have presented, and that have all the lines written in. A script can be a napkin that you've written out moments before you have to go on stage. A script can is any piece of writing that allows you to reflect on what you want to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem with the script, is that it suggests everything is done. It suggests everything is boxed up and all you need to do is recapitulate that script in front of people. There's nothing worse than a statically read script, because scripts are words on paper. They're not words coming out of your mouth. So you have to take those words and transform them into a way that's comfortable for you to speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's difficult and I'm going to suggest two modes of getting those words from the paper, from the slide screen, into your mouth and back out. The first I'm calling rehearsal, and the second I'm calling reverse outlining. Rehearsal and reverse outlining in my mind they go together. And in fact, you can be at a place where you have plenty of time to rehearse, plenty of time to reverse outline, and then you can dynamically understand your script. But you can also be in a place where all you have time to do is outline and reverse outline, and that can help you as well. The point is you need to own the script. The script is what guides you, and you need to own it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the best way to rehearse, is to read the document out loud over and over in front of a mirror.\n",
    "You are your own harshest critic. And by listening to the words coming out of your mouth, you will recognize if the sentences are too long, if the words don't sound like you, or if the words themselves are abstract and complicated and they break down in your mouth and you can't say them. You will recognise those words don't work. And you'll have to edit your script. You will have to figure out where to stop and think, where to breathe, when to breathe in, when to breathe out. When I first started rehearsing, I would strip naked and stand in front of the mirror and read my script to myself. Because that was my bare self and my eyes would judge and my ears will hear together what my body and what my mouth were doing. And to me, that was the moment where I really learned to deliver. So I encourage you, when you rehearse, don't just stand in front of a group of friends. They'll just tell you some nice corrections. Go to a quiet place, stand in front of a mirror, and rehearse.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I want to acknowledge at the close of this video, that many times, you will be in a position where you have no choice but to follow exactly the words on the script, and if you deviate, you will be in trouble. In those cases, I still encourage you to rehearse. You don't have the liberty to change the script, but you do have the ability to own it, and that's what I want you to do. In all cases, by rehearsing a script you own it, and you internalize it, and the words become yours. And it is critical, if your audience is going to believe you, that you believe the words you are speaking."

    "Reverse outlining is a little more of an improvisational technique than simply rehearsing your script. When you have a script that you've rehearsed and you feel like the script is solid, you try and recreate the outline on a piece of paper. Just go over that outline, and try and recreate it from memory. The reason I call this reverse outlining is because you have to recreate the outline after you've rehearsed the script. Even if you have to read the script over, recreating the outline on a separate piece of paper will help you tremendously. Because it will mean that you're really familiar with the beats and the important points of the script. It will mean that you've internalized it enough that you don't really have to worry about getting lost anymore. "

    "\n",
    "Bold letters that you skip over as you read, your eye will literally catch the letter, and you'll say it. Bold words that you are having trouble saying or that you want to emphasize.

    "Mark rising inflection with a diagonal line or arrow upwards. Mark lowering inflection with a diagonal line or arrow downwards. Write in pauses.\n",

    "We can take three things. One, literally marking the script with inflection points and developing the rhythm will help us get through. Two, as we mark the script, we begin to learn how we want to speak. We get over the problems of our own voice, and we begin to really articulate the lines inside of us. And the third point, which is it's not just a one time learning event. It's learning over a lifetime of reading. So you may begin by marking a script very intensely, or you may be faced with a tough script and really need to go over it. But the very act of marking a script is a process of rehearsal that teaches you how to control your own language. It teaches you how to work with inflection points and rhythm by concentrating you on the words of your script.\n",

And survival reactions, if you'll recall are not just intellectual, and they're not just verbal, they're also very physical. So we need to recognize our body. And in recognizing our bodies we can control those survival reactions, we can replace unintended gestures with intentional gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing your body is the first step in defeating survival reactions. Rehearse so you replace survival reactions with intentional gestures. Wear appropriate but comfortable clothing. You need a firm stance as a foundation to make your point, so experiment with stances. Don't just rock back and forth. Figure out how you like to stand and intentionally stand that way. Feel large, even if you are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, recognizing your body will help you in many ways. Practice your movement in concert with your script. So if you're counting things off in your script, count them off with your fingers. Say first, and hold up one. Second, and hold up two. This will give your points emphasis. If you are punctuating a point do so with your hands as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your body is part of what makes you a successful communicator. It doesn't need to hold you back. What you need to do is think about how to deploy your attributes, think about how to present yourself successfully, the rest will follow."

    "Throughout this MOOC, we've tried to tell a story of the self. In the first module, it was the story of the self in fear fragmented by fear. Pursued by a ghost that was at once, over our own making but also external and real, causing us to break apart in chaos. In the second module, I suggested a container for the self. A formula that could hold us together in structure but that in a way was a prison. We had to exceed it, through one compelling point that might express our own vision, our own brilliance. And then, in the third, I introduced new paradox, a paradox that by rehearsing diligently we could arrive at a point of spontaneity.\n",

People may come in in the middle of our talk and walk out on our presentation, at the best part. People may begin side conversations, cellphones or go off and just keep going on and on. And all these things are out of our control. So as diligently as we might rehearse, we're faced with the question, how can we control these variables. And in fact, we can control these variables. Because we create the community that we live in. We create that community through our own sense of performance. We create it through our own hyper aware sense of everyone in the room. If we've created our community strongly, we've constructed it around our presentation and we don't need to worry about those interruptions. We can keep things on focus, we can keep ourselves centered and therefore, as we're the leaders of our community, our community centered."

The second is dividing the space up in your mind, so you feel that you can move amongst them even if you can't leave the stage. The third is how you use ancillary materials in your presentation. But my one compelling point here, the thing I want you to take home is that you can control the room. Even though the room is filled with variables, you can control that room.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the room is larger than a small group, a lecture hall for instance or a conference presentation, you might arrive early and talk to people. Or you might simply study their faces as you walk out on stage. Remember, one of the first survival reaction is to target fixate on one person, to make the whole experience about them, or alternately to see the whole room as just a mass, an unapproachable group. So to that end I want you to divide the room in your mind's eye. Divide it into quadrants, left, right, center, forward, middle, back. By dividing it into these quadrants, you can begin to think of groups of people, and you can move from them in a studied and disciplined fashion. If you're in a conference room, a smaller room, or sitting in a circular table, think of it as a clock. That will allow you to move from number the number, even if you can't remember people's names in a disciplined fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is that you're building community, and your presentation materials also need to build community. They need to be part of that. So slide decks are very effective. Slide decks can be effective because they focus everyone's attention in one direction. And they can present images which you can't present verbally or physically through your body. But the problem with a slide deck is it's always behind you, or it's on an individual screen. A slide deck either focuses people to look at your back or to look away from you at the screen they're studying. This is a problem because it necessarily alienates them from you. It's a double problem if you have a slide deck with a lot of words and you have to really spend time with your back to the audience working those words. That alienates your community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately handouts are great. Handouts, they act as a intermediary between you and your audience. If you handout a bunch of handouts, then it's like you're sharing a meal. You're all focused forward, looking down or looking together. Handouts create a sense of community. But the problem with handouts is they put all your information up front. And of course, some people will go forward ahead of your talk. That will be distracting to you, a little bit unnerving. And other people will go back. After you've left a point behind, they'll be studying number one. That will make you nervous because maybe there's something you misspelled or perhaps missed otherwise. Handouts and slide decks are both compromised, neither is perfect. You need to think about the stakes of using them so that you can use them in a smart and calculated fashion. The point, the point of all of this is that you need to listen to your audience. You need to imagine your audience ahead of time and think about how you want to present to them. And when you're in the room, you need to actually listen to them. If you can listen to your audience while you are talking, then you are truly a master presenter."

If you can't understand the question or if you haven't been listening, ask the speaker to repeat the question. Be respectful. Now I've been through a lot of question and answer sessions.

    "\n",
    "Third, since the question is a chance to respond and elaborate, don't be afraid to think. When you're in front of a group, feel free to think. This goes back to one of the first rules of the course. This is a course about storytelling, and people want to watch people. So, remember, you're on stage, and if you think through smartly a question, and you really look like you're concentrating, people will be fascinated.\n",
